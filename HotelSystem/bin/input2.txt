//this test case covers the case where the new bookking made is in between of 2 booking
// the booking order is this way: Aarthi - new_booking - Herman
// when new_booking is Andreas because the end period is after the start period for Herman booking
// Andreas does not get allocated to Surfers Hotel, instead got allocated to Rock Hotel
// when new_booking is Jacky the slot is allocated to him as his booking period doesnot
// overlap with the adjacent booking period
