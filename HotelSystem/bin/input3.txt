// Case where hotel randwick has room with capacity 4 therefore, the creation is cancelled
// Aldo's booking must be rejected because no hotels have 4 single rooms
// Nelson's booking rejected because hotel is full for the period
// Bill's booking rejected because the hotels are booked from 17-18 Aug while he wants to stay from 16-27 Aug
// Change Nico's booking to 18 Aug and test by letting Nelson book for 17 Aug
